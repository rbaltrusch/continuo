# Music Generation

This tool procedurally generates music based on codified Western classical music principles.

## Next steps

- Planning to extract parameterization into an external config file.
- Planning to add a graphical user interface to make it easier to interact with the tool and change the tool configuration

## Parameterization

Custom parameterization is possible, but currently not consolidated into one config file.
